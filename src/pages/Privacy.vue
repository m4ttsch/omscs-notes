        <li>
          <strong>Legal obligations:</strong> Processing Personal Data is
          necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Company

        <li>
          <strong>Vital interests:</strong> Processing Personal Data is

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Public interests:</strong> Processing Personal Data is related
          to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
